# Math App

This is a simple web application that performs basic arithmetic operations. You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers directly in the browser.

## Development

Open `index.html` in your browser to use the app locally. The app is completely static and consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) if you don't have it.
2. Run `vercel` in the project directory and follow the prompts to deploy.

A `vercel.json` configuration file is included so the project can be deployed as a static site.
